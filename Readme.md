## Overview

The Dolby.io Communications C# SDK provides Client applications the ability to create HD voice and video for fully immersive real-time communications and streaming experiences. The C# SDK allows creating an application that can join Dolby.io conferences.

The C# SDK is responsible for communicating with the Dolby.io backend and providing conferencing functionalities, such as opening and closing sessions, joining and leaving conferences, sending and receiving messages, as well as receiving and injecting WebRTC media streams.

The C# SDK can connect to only one conference at a time. Joining multiple conferences at a time requires running multiple instances of the application.

## Client Applications

Using the Dolby.io Communications C# SDK Client applications have the ability to join Dolby Voice Conferences where they can send and receive HD voice streams, including spatial audio and shared scenes. This functionality is useful for integrating the HD Dolby Voice experience into your own game engine or virtual world experience. To offer this functionality, the C# SDK provides applications the ability to capture and playback audio, manage input/output Audio Devices, add spatial placement for participants as well as partake in a shared spatial scene.
