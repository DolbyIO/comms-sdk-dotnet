# Dolby.io Communications .NET SDK

The Dolby.io Communications .NET SDK allows creating applications with high audio quality that you can use for conferencing, streaming, and collaborating in virtual spaces.

The .NET SDK depends on the C++ SDK for core functionalities and communicates with the Dolby.io backend to provide conferencing functionalities. The SDK is especially useful for integrating the HD Dolby Voice experience into your own game engine or virtual world experience. To offer this functionality, the .NET SDK provides applications the ability to capture and play audio, manage input and output audio devices, add spatial placement for participants, as well as participate in a shared spatial scene.
