# Dolby.io Communications .NET SDK

The Dolby.io Communications .NET SDK allows creating high-quality video conferencing applications. The .NET SDK communicates with the Dolby.io backend and provides conferencing functionalities, such as opening and closing sessions, joining and leaving conferences, sending and receiving messages, and injecting and receiving WebRTC media streams. An additional advantage of the SDK is the [spatial audio](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/guides-spatial-audio) support. This functionality is especially useful for game engines and virtual spaces. The .NET SDK allows placing conference participants spatially in a 3D-rendered audio scene and hear the participants' audio rendered at the given locations. Additionally, the SDK offers spatial audio styles to either let the local participant set remote participants' positions or allow creating a spatial scene shared by all participants, where the relative positions among participants are calculated by the Dolby.io server.

The .NET SDK can connect to only one conference at a time. Joining multiple conferences at a time requires running multiple instances of the application.
